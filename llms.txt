# Technical Summary for Mind Map App (llms.txt)

## Data Structures
- **Concept**: { id: number, x: number, y: number, title: string, bullets: string }
- **Relation**: { id: number, from: number, to: number }
- **concepts**: Array of Concept objects (reactive, persisted in localStorage)
- **relations**: Array of Relation objects (reactive, persisted in localStorage)

## Canvas & Viewport
- Canvas fills the viewport (100vw x 100vh), with a grid background that moves/scales with pan/zoom.
- Pan is managed by `offset` (x, y), and zoom by `scale` (float, min 0.2, max 3).
- Pan and zoom are persisted in localStorage.
- Zoom is centered on the mouse cursor using the standard 'zoom to cursor' algorithm.

## Concepts (Nodes)
- Rendered as absolutely positioned divs, draggable, editable (title and Markdown bullets).
- Selected concept is highlighted with a blue border.
- Double-click on empty canvas adds a new concept at that position.
- Single-click selects a concept and shows its details in the right sidebar.
- Dragging a concept disables canvas panning.
- Each concept's DOM element is measured for pixel-perfect relation rendering.

## Relations (Links)
- Created by clicking the 'relation' button, then selecting two concepts (start and end).
- Rendered as SVG lines/arrows between the real edge of each concept (using DOMRect intersection for pixel-perfect accuracy).
- Multiple relations per concept are allowed.
- Clicking a line selects it (highlighted in red); pressing Delete/Backspace removes it.
- Clicking the canvas background deselects the line.
- Relations are listed in the right sidebar for the selected concept.

## UI
- Left sidebar: List of all concepts with coordinates.
- Right sidebar: Details and Markdown bullets for the selected concept, plus a list of its relations.
- Bottom bar: 'Relation' button to enter relation-creation mode, with hints.
- Coordinates overlay in the top right shows current world coordinates under the mouse.

## Persistence
- All concepts, relations, pan/zoom state are saved in localStorage and restored on reload.

## Other
- Grid background is always visible and fills the viewport, scaling and moving with pan/zoom.
- All pointer events are managed so that concepts, lines, and canvas background are interactable as expected.
- The code is written in Vue 3 with <script setup> syntax.
